# HADA: automated annotation of next-generation sequencing data in hereditary angioedema studies


This repository presents HADA, a database for genetic variation related to Hereditary Angioedema, comprising several information for clinical interpretation of each reported mutation in pathogenesis development. The information was used to establish a database configured for ANNOVAR to be seamlessly incorporated into the routine NGS bioinformatics annotation. See list below:

Background
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease caused by dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor or dysregulation of the kinin cascade. Because of its non-specific signs, HAE is poorly recognized in the clinical field, resulting in delayed diagnoses that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. To adapt its diagnosis to next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assessments, we developed Hereditary Angioedema Database Annotation (HADA) tool. Currently, HADA includes records for 416 simple causal variants in the five genes underlying HAE. However, 25% of those were classified as non-pathogenic by current guidelines, suggestive of a gap in the interpretation of disease variants and a necessity to improve the classifiers of pathogenicity potential of genetic variants


We performed a manual curation and update to GRCh37/hg19 of the causal variants described to date in HAEdb and VarSome and classified all of them to the ACMG guidelines.

Hereditary Angioedema Database Annotation






Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease caused by dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor or dysregulation of the kinin cascade. Because of its non-specific signs, HAE is poorly recognized in the clinical field, resulting in delayed diagnoses that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. To adapt its diagnosis to next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assessments, we developed Hereditary Angioedema Database Annotation (HADA) tool.
